# Landing Page – The Odin Project

This project is a fully custom Landing Page built as part of the **Foundations course** in The Odin Project.  
The goal was to practice the essential front-end skills learned so far, including HTML structure, semantic tags, CSS layout techniques, Flexbox, spacing, and basic responsive design.

The design is based on a reference image provided in the lesson, and the challenge was to rebuild it from scratch using only the concepts covered so far.
